# Audio Cloak Project

## Overview

The Audio Cloak Project is an open-source initiative aimed at developing a system for cloaking audio recordings to protect against unauthorized use in training deep learning models. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of the Fawkes project on image cloaking, our goal is to extend similar protections to the audio domain. This endeavor seeks to empower individuals with the ability to shield their music and other kinds of audio content from AI models trained without their consent, thus preserving ones unique style from generative AI platforms.

## Inspiration

Our work draws inspiration from the [Fawkes image cloaking software](https://github.com/Shawn-Shan/fawkes) developed by researchers from the University of Chicago. The Fawkes project demonstrated a novel approach to protecting personal images from unauthorized facial recognition models. By making subtle alterations to digital photos before sharing them online, Fawkes effectively "cloaks" an individual's identity, causing any derived facial recognition model to misidentify them.

The concept of audio cloaking was further encouraged by a [technical review](https://repository.fit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1793&context=etd) and the collective efforts of the [University of Chicago's SAND Lab team](https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/). Their scientific contributions, outlined in their [published academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08327), and the broader implications reported in [University of Chicago News](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-scientists-develop-new-tool-protect-artists-ai-mimicry), have laid the foundation for our project.

## Project Status

The Audio Cloak Project is currently in development and is a work in progress. Our team is actively working on algorithms and methods to cloak audio efficiently without compromising the original audio's perceptual quality. While the project is nascent, we are making strides toward a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of audio cloaking.

## Open Source and Collaboration

This project is open source and we warmly invite collaboration from interested individuals and organizations. Whether you are a researcher, developer, privacy advocate, or just passionate about the ethical implications of AI, your contributions are welcome. We believe in the power of community-driven development and the importance of open collaboration to address the challenges posed by unauthorized use of AI technologies.
