    Evaluate the effectiveness of cloaked audio against a target model.

    Parameters:
    - audio_data: np.ndarray, the cloaked audio data to be evaluated. Possibly use it to refine cloaking.
    - model: A pre-trained model that will be used to classify the audio data.
    - original_label: The true label of the audio data before cloaking, used to compare the model's performance.

    Returns:
    - success_rate: float, the rate at which the cloaking is successful in evading correct classification.
    - model_output: The output of the model when classifying the cloaked audio.
