    Optimize the perturbations to ensure they are effective and imperceptible.

    Parameters:
    - initial_perturbations: np.ndarray, initial guess of the perturbations.
    - audio_features: np.ndarray, the original features of the audio to cloak.
    - model: The model used to evaluate the effectiveness of cloaking.
    - perceptual_model: A model or function to evaluate the perceptual quality of the audio.
    - max_iterations: int, maximum number of optimization iterations.
    - alpha: float, learning rate for the optimization.
    - beta: float, weighting factor for the perceptual loss.
    - epsilon: float, tolerance for early stopping.
